You can do the following in relation to the DSA subjects:

- Make a road map that covers all the topics to help you get started and where you need to go.
- Learn as much as you can by taking a paid course, for example. Once you've done something and spent money on it, you won't need a motivation to do it again.
- Students usually make use of subpar learning resources because they lack direction, which keeps them from mastering data structures and algorithms. Instead, they decided to stop learning more and being interested in the subject.
- Students should choose a trustworthy platform where they may watch video courses and regularly assess their competence before beginning to understand data structures and algorithms.
- Learn the fundamentals correctly: Recognize each data structure's uses before implementing it in your preferred programming language.
  Then, educate yourself on the following topics:

Time complexity analysis
Arrays
Stack
Queue (Deque)
Math based coding questions
Bit Manipulation
Linked List
Sorting Algos
Strings
Recursion
Backtracking
Hash Map, Set, Heap (priority queue), Multiset
Binary Search
Greedy Approach
Two Pointer Approach
Binary Tree (Binary Search Tree)
Dynamic Programming
Graph and Disjoint Set Union

Practice these thematic questions on certain platforms to hone your logical and problem-solving skills. Visit YouTube and watch the lecture where they explain how they addressed the problem if you ever find yourself stuck on a certain topic. Practice the questions diligently.
