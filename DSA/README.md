# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScipt
# Notes

Big-O Notation:
O(1) - Constant Time/Space complexity:
 it means that it will always run in the same amount of time, no matter the input size.
 the time to execute is the same regardless of the input size.

O(N) - Linear Time/Space complexity:
 it means that the runtime of the algorithm grows almost linearly with the input size.
 The runtime grows linearly with the input size.

O(N^2) - Quadratic Time/Space complexity:
 the processing time of an algorithm is proportional to the square of the input elements.
 the size of the input is squared. There is a loop in a loop.

O(logN) - Logarithmic Time/Space complexity:
 it means that as the input size grows, the number of operations grows very slowly.
 The input size reduces by half every iteration.

Asymptatic notation:
 Is a mathematical tool that calculates the required time in terms of input size and does not require the execution of the code.

Big-O Notation (Ο) – Big-O notation specifically describes the worst-case scenario.
Omega Notation (Ω) – Omega(Ω) notation specifically describes the best-case scenario.
Theta Notation (θ) – This notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm.
